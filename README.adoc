This build was created and tested using CentOS 7.3. I pretty much guarantee that it won't work with anything else other than RHEL 7. Unless you have an operational need, I would suggest basing your system off of CentOS 7.3 (build 1611), as that is where the bulk of the testing of this has happened.

NOTE: If your build isn't working, please review the <<hardware-requirements,Hardware Requirements>> and <<autodetect-assumptions,Autodetect Assumptions>>. The auto-generation script has to make some assumptions.

**BE ADVISED:** This build process takes 3-10 minutes depending on your underlying hardware. There will be times where it seems like it quit. Be patient. You'll know when it's done, for better or worse.

== Getting Started

If you'd like to cut through the fluff and get going, check out the link:content/getting-started.adoc[ROCK 2.0 Getting Started Guide].

[[hardware-requirements]]
== Hardware Requirements
_(For anything other than a Vagrant build)_

NOTE: This is a shadow of a recommendation of a guideline. Your mileage may vary. No returns or refunds.

|===
| Resource | Recommendation

| CPU
| 4 or more physical cores.

| Memory
| 16GB (You can get away with 8GB, but it won't collect for long.)

| Storage
| 256GB, with 200+ of that dedicated to `/data`. Honestly, throw everything you can at it. The higher the IOPS the better.

| Network
| The system needs at least 2 network interfaces, one for management and one for collection.
|===

**GOLDEN RULE:** If you throw hardware at it, ROCK will use it. It will require some tuning to do so, but we'll continue documenting that.

[[autodetect-assumptions]]
== Autodetect Assumptions

When writing the scripts to generate default values, we had to make some assumptions. The defaults are generated according to these assumptions and should generally work if your sensor aligns with them. That said, these assumptions will give you a working sensor, but may need some love for higher performance. If you cannot meet these assumptions, look at the indicated configuration variables in `/etc/rocknsm/config.yml` for workaround approaches (with impact on performance).

* You have two network interfaces:
** A management interface with a default route
** An interface without a default route (defined by `rock_monifs`)

TIP: We assume that any interface that does not have a default route will be used for collection. Each sensor application will be configured accordingly.

WARNING: This so far has been the number one problem with a fresh install for beta testers!! Check your interface configuration!!

* You have mounted your largest storage volume(s) under `/data/` (defined by `rock_data_dir`)
* Your hostname (FQDN) is defined in the `playbooks/inventory/all-in-one.ini` file.
* You allow management via SSH from any network (defined by `rock_mgmt_nets`)
* You wish to use Bro, Suricata, Stenographer (disabled by default) and the whole data pipeline. (See `with_*` options)
* If installed via ISO, you will perform an offline install, else we assume online (defined by `rock_online_install`)j
* Bro will use half of your CPU resources, up to 8 CPUs

== Differences in ROCK 2.0

Lots has changed in the past year or so since we released the initial Chef build. First and foremost, the build now uses Ansible for the automation. Most packages are updated to the latest greatest, and we've swapped in Suricata and the default signature IDS over Snort. Some of the most significant upgrade, from a use standpoint, is the work we've put into Kibana. The data model is slightly different, to the advantage of the analyst.

For more details, see the link:#[Release Notes] once we make them available.

For more on the data model, see link:#[Data Model] once we document that.


== Vagrant

This Vagrantfile is configured to give the VM 8GB of RAM. If your system can't do that you should buy a new system or adjust the `vm.memory` value. Anything below 8 is going to run like poopoo. You will also need to have a host-only adapter configured named `vboxnet0`.

```
git clone https://github.com/rocknsm/rock.git
cd rock
vagrant up
```

== Physical/Virtual/Non-Vagrant

The system you run this on should have at least 2 network interfaces and more than 8GB of RAM, with an OS (RHEL or CentOS 7) already installed. See the <<hardware-requirements,Hardware Requirements>> section for details.
```
sudo yum update -y && reboot
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum install -y git ansible
git clone https://github.com/rocknsm/rock.git
cd rock/bin
sudo ./generate_defaults.sh
sudo ./deploy_rock.sh
```

== Usage

=== Start / Stop / Status
Accomplished with `rock_stop`, `rock_start`, and `rock_status`.

TIP: These may need to be prefaced with /usr/local/bin/ depending on your PATH.

== Basic Troubleshooting
=== Functions Check:
```
# After the initial build, the ES cluster will be yellow because the marvel index will think it's missing a replica. Run this to fix this issue. This job will run from cron just after midnight every day.
/usr/local/bin/es_cleanup.sh 2>&1 > /dev/null

# Check to see that the ES cluster says it's green:
curl -s localhost:9200/_cluster/health | jq '.'

# See how many documents are in the indexes. The count should be non-zero.
curl -s localhost:9200/_all/_count | jq '.'

# You can fire some traffic across the sensor at this point to see if it's collecting.
# NOTE: This requires that you upload your own test PCAP to the box.
sudo tcpreplay -i [your monitor interface] /path/to/a/test.pcap

# After replaying some traffic, or just waiting a bit, the count should be going up.
curl -s localhost:9200/_all/_count | jq '.'

# You should have plain text bro logs showing up in /data/bro/logs/current/:
ls -ltr /data/bro/logs/current/

# Kafkacat is your kafka swiss army knife. This command will consume the current queue. You should see a non-zero offset.
kafkacat -C -b localhost -t bro_raw -e | wc -l

# If you haven't loaded kibana already, it should be running on port 5601. This just verifies while you're still on the command line.
sudo netstat -planet | grep node
```

=== Key web interfaces:
IPADDRESS = The management interface of the box, or "localhost" if you did the vagrant build.

http://IPADDRESS - Kibana


=== Full Packet Capture
Google's Stenographer is installed and configured in this build. However, it is disabled by default. There are a few reasons for this: First, it can be too much for Vagrant builds on meager hardware. Second, you really need to make sure you've mounted /data over sufficient storage before you start saving full packets. Once you're ready to get nuts, enable and start the service with `systemctl enable stenographer.service` and then `systemctl start stenographer.service`. Stenographer is already stubbed into the `/usr/local/bin/rock_{start,stop,status}` scripts, you just need to uncomment it if you're going to use it.

== THANKS
This architecture is made possible by the efforts of the Missouri National Guard Cyber Team for donating talent and resources to further development.


== Approach

The Ansible playbook that drives this build strives not to use any external roles or other dependencies. The reasoning behind this is to make the rock playbook a "one-stop" reference for a manual build. This allows users to use the build process as a guide when doing larger scale production roll outs without having to decipher a labyrinth of dependencies.

Templated config files have comment sections added near key config items with useful info. They don't all have it, but they get added as remembered.
