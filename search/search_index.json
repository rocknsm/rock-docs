This can be done by logging in locally, or remotely via ssh . ROCK has been designed to require as little configuration as possible out of the box. This document covers much of gear turning available to advanced users, but please know up front that you can simply run the deploy script and get a working sensor. With that said, let's get into the 2 main configuration files found in /etc/rocknsm/ . Hosts File \u00b6 The first file you may want to edit is /etc/rocknsm/hosts.ini . This file is an Ansible inventory file that defines the target machines when running a playbook. If you edit this file in a simple standalone sensor, you're essentially changing the hostname of your sensor. [rock] simplerockbuild.simplerock.lan ansible_host = 127.0.0.1 ansible_connection=local [web] simplerockbuild.simplerock.lan ansible_host = 127.0.0.1 ansible_connection=local [sensors:children] rock [bro:children] sensors ... ... ... As you can see in the above example, the default hostname is simplerockbuild.simplerock.lan . To customize this, simply replace all simplerock entries with your own. Config File \u00b6 The next file ( /etc/rocknsm/config.yml ) drives the Ansible playbook and contains key variables like network interface setup, cpu cores assignment, and much more. There are a lot of options to tune here so take time to familiarize. Let's break down this file into it's major sections: Network Interface \u00b6 As mentioned previously, ROCK takes the interface with an ip address / gateway and will use that as the management NIC. config.yml displays the remaining interfaces that will be used to MONITOR traffic. Let's run through a basic example: [admin@rock ~]$ ip a 1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000 2: enp0s3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000 link/ether ... inet 192.168.1.207/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global noprefixroute dynamic enp0s3 ... 3: enp0s4: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000 link/ether ... The demo box above has 2 NICs: 1. enp0s3 - is plugged in for install and deployment with an ip address from local dhcp. This will be used to manage the sensor 2. enp0s4 - will be unused (not connected) during install and deployment and be listed as a rock_monif in the config file The config file shows the other interface ( enp0s3 ) is listed as MONITOR interface. # interfaces that should be configured for sensor applications rock_monifs: - enp0s3 Sensor Resource \u00b6 # Set the hostname of the sensor: rock_hostname: rocknsm_sensor_1 # Set the Fully Qualified Domain Name: rock_fqdn: rocknsm_sensor_1.rocknsm.lan # Set the number of CPUs assigned to Bro: bro_cpu: 2 # Set the Elasticsearch cluster name: es_cluster_name: rocknsm # Set the Elasticsearch cluster node name: es_node_name: localhost # Set the value of Elasticsearch memory: es_mem: 5 Installation Source \u00b6 We've taken into consideration that your sensor won't always have internet access. Currently the default value is set to rock_online_install: True : # The primary installation variable defines the ROCK installation method: # ONLINE: used if the system may reach out to the internet # OFFLINE: used if the system may *NOT* reach out to the internet # The default value \"False\" will deploy using OFFLINE (local) repos. # A value of \"True\" will perform an install using ONLINE mirrors. rock_online_install: True Online \u00b6 Does your sensor has access to upstream online repositories? If so, then make sure that this value is set to rock_online_install: True . Offline \u00b6 If you are in an offline environment, then set it to rock_online_install: False . Ansible will deploy using the locally cached files found in /srv/rocknsm . Note: In our next release the default behavior will be changed to an offline install (reference Issue #376 ) Data Retention \u00b6 This section controls how long NSM data stay on the sensor: # Set the interval in which Elasticsearch indexes are closed: elastic_close_interval: 15 # Set the interval in which Elasticsearch indexes are deleted: elastic_delete_interval: 60 # Set value for Kafka retention (in hours): kafka_retention: 168 # Set value for Bro log retention (in days): bro_log_retention: 0 # Set value for Bro statistics log retention (in days): bro_stats_retention: 0 # Set how often logrotate will roll Suricata log (in days): suricata_retention: 3 # Set value for FSF log retention (in days): fsf_retention: 3 ROCK Component Options \u00b6 This is a critical section that provides boolean options to choose what components of ROCK are installed and enabled during deployment. # The following \"with_\" statements define what components of RockNSM are # installed when running the deploy script: with_stenographer: True with_docket: True with_bro: True with_suricata: True with_snort: True with_suricata_update: True with_logstash: True with_elasticsearch: True with_kibana: True with_zookeeper: True with_kafka: True with_lighttpd: True with_fsf: True # The following \"enable_\" statements define what RockNSM component services # are enabled (start automatically on system boot): enable_stenographer: True enable_docket: True enable_bro: True enable_suricata: True enable_snort: True enable_suricata_update: True enable_logstash: True enable_elasticsearch: True enable_kibana: True enable_zookeeper: True enable_kafka: True enable_lighttpd: True enable_fsf: True A good example for changing this section would involve Stenographer . Collecting raw PCAP is resource and storage intensive .

It's dangerous to deploy sensors alone... take these minumum requirements : 8GB RAM 4 Physical Cores 256GB disk 2 NICs active connection on mgmt port Network Connection \u00b6 This is a critical setup point: Before booting to the ISO, connect the network interface that you intend to use to remotely manage ROCK. Why? During install, ROCK will see the network interface with an ip address and default gateway and designate it as the management port. So plug into that interface and boot to your USB drive. Install Types \u00b6 ROCK works with both legacy BIOS and UEFI booting. Once booted from the USB, you are presented with 2 primary installation paths: Automated Custom Automated \u00b6 The \"Automated\" option is intended to serve as a starting point that allows you to get into things. It uses the Centos Anaconda installer to make some of the harder decisions for users by skipping over many options to get you up and running. It makes a best guess at how to use resources -- most notably how to manage available disks. Bottom line: think of this as a product quickstart mode, perfect for installing on a VM or other temporary hardware. It is not for production sensor deployment. For the rest of this install guide we'll work through the more detail oriented \"Custom Install of ROCK\" option. Custom \u00b6 The \"Custom\" allows for more customization of a ROCK installation. This is especially helpful when you're working with multiple disks or even a large amount of storage on a single disk. The Custom option is recommended for production environments in order to get more granular in choosing how disk space is allocated. Disk Allocation \u00b6 Configuring disk and storage is a deep topic on it's own, but let's talke about a few examples to get started: Stenographer \u00b6 A common gotcha occurs when you want full packet capture (via Stenographer ), but it isn't given a separate partition. Stenographer is great at managing it's own disk space (starts to overwrite oldest data at 90% capacity), but that doesn't cut it when it's sharing the same mount point as Bro, Suricata , and other tools that generate data in ROCK. Best practice would be to create a /data/stenographer partition in order to prevent limited operations. For example, Elasticsearch will (rightfully) lock indexes up to a read-only state in order to keep things from crashing hard. System Logs \u00b6 Another useful partition to create is /var/log to separate system log files from the rest of the system. Example Table \u00b6 Below is a good starting point when partitioning MOUNT POINT USAGE SIZE SYSTEM SYSTEM SYSTEM / root filesystem 15 GiB /boot legacy boot files 512 MiB /boot/efi uefi boot files 512 MiB swap memory shortage ~8 GiB+ DATA DATA DATA /var/log system log files ~15 GiB /home user home dirs ~20 GiB /data data partition ~ GiB /data/stenographer steno partition ~ GiB For more information to assist with the partitioning process, you can see the RHEL guide . Also, it may be a bit more self explanatory for you if you click \u201cautomatic partitions\u201d then modify accordingly. Date & Time \u00b6 UTC is generally preferred for logging data as the timestamps from anywhere in the world will have a proper order without calculating offsets and daylight savings. That said, Kibana will present the Bro logs according to your timezone (as set in the browser). The bro logs themselves (i.e. in /data/bro/logs/) log in epoch time and will be written in UTC regardless of the system timezone. Bro includes a utility for parsing these on the command line called bro-cut . It can be used to print human-readable timestamps in either the local sensor timezone or UTC. You can also give it a custom format string to specify what you'd like displayed. Network & Hostname \u00b6 Before beginning the install process it's best to connect the interface you've selected to be the management interface . Here's the order of events: ROCK will initially look for an interface with a default gateway and treat that interface as the MGMT INTERFACE All remaining interfaces will be treated as MONITOR INTERFACES Ensure that the interface you intend to use for MGMT has been turned on and has an ip address Set the hostname of the sensor in the bottom left corner this hostname will populate the Ansible inventory file in /etc/rocknsm/hosts.ini User Creation \u00b6 ROCK is configured with the root user disabled. We recommend that you leave it that way. Once you've kicked off the install, click User Creation at the next screen (shown above) and complete the required fields to set up a non-root admin user. If this step is not completed during install, do not fear. you will be prompted to create this account after first login. Wrapping Up \u00b6 Once the install is complete you will be able to click Finish Installation and then reboot. You can then accept the license agreement: c (ontinue) + ENTER The sshd services is enabled at startup, so if you intend to complete the next steps remotely, note the management ip address now by running ip a .","title":"Installation"},{"location":"install/install/#installation-guide","text":"Let's just hold on for one hot minute before installing, just in case you like to skip around.

Autodetect Assumptions \u00b6 When writing the scripts to generate default values, we had to make some assumptions. The defaults are generated according to these assumptions and should generally work if your sensor aligns with them. That said, these assumptions will give you a working sensor, but may need some love for higher performance. If you cannot meet these assumptions, look at the indicated configuration variables in /etc/rocknsm/config.yml for workaround approaches (with impact on performance). TIP: We assume that any interface that does not have a default route will be used for collection. Each sensor application will be configured accordingly.
