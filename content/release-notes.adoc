On top of software updates, we also changed the deployment mechanism to using Ansible as the primary mechanism. We did this for a few reasons: I used it for one of my full-time projects, it's super lightweight and available in EPEL, doesn't require an agent, super easy to understand. I'm hoping that ultimately this makes the platform more approachable to a wider community and better suitable to offline or isolated install environments, which I've frequently encountered for sensor networks.

On that last note, we now have an ISO that _should_ contain everything you need to deploy. The ISO is merely a snapshot of packages available at the time and latest snapshot of various Git repositories.
